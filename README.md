📊 Blinkit Sales Analysis Dashboard
Welcome to the Blinkit Sales Analysis project! 🚀
This end‑to‑end case study transforms raw Blinkit sales data into clean visuals, meaningful KPIs, and business‑ready insights using Excel for data preparation and Power BI for interactive dashboards. ✨
The goal is not just to build charts, but to tell a clear data story that any stakeholder can understand in a few minutes. 💬📈

🎯 Project Objective
This project focuses on understanding how different factors impact Blinkit’s sales performance and customer satisfaction.
The main objective is to analyze:

  * 💰 Overall sales performance across all outlets

  * 🧺 Product mix based on item type and fat content

  * 🏬 Outlet behavior by size, type, location, and establishment

  * 😀 Customer feedback through item ratings

All of this is combined into a single, interactive Power BI dashboard that can help business users make faster and smarter decisions. ⚡

📌 Key KPIs Tracked
To keep the analysis focused and actionable, the dashboard highlights four core KPIs:

  * 💵 Total Sales – Overall revenue generated from all items sold

  * 📈 Average Sales – Average revenue per sale

  * 📦 Number of Items – Total count of different items sold

  * ⭐ Average Rating – Overall customer rating for items

These KPIs are sliced and filtered across multiple dimensions such as fat content, item type, outlet type, outlet size, outlet location, and outlet establishment year/type, giving a 360° view of performance. 🔍

📊 Charts & Visual Insights
The report is designed with a mix of visual types to answer real business questions clearly and quickly:

  * 🥗 Total Sales by Fat Content – See how fat content (Low Fat vs Regular etc.) influences sales and ratings

  * 🛒 Total Sales by Item Type – Identify which product categories drive the most revenue

  * 🧂 Fat Content by Outlet for Total Sales – Compare outlets based on what kind of products they sell more

  * 🏢 Total Sales by Outlet Establishment – Understand how outlet age/type impacts performance over time

  * 📍 Sales by Outlet Location – Explore the geographic spread of sales and spot high‑performing areas

  * 📐 Sales by Outlet Size – Analyze how store size relates to overall revenue

  * 🧱 All Metrics by Outlet Type (Matrix) – A single matrix card that combines Total Sales, Average Sales, Number of Items, and Average Rating by outlet type

Each visual is carefully formatted with consistent colors, clear labels, and intuitive filters, making it easy even for non‑technical users to interact with the report. 🎯

🔄 End‑to‑End Project Workflow
This project follows a complete, professional analytics lifecycle, similar to how dashboards are built in real companies:

  1. 📝 Requirement Gathering / Business Understanding
Clarifying what the business wants to know, what decisions need support, and which KPIs matter most.

  2. 👀 Data Walkthrough
Exploring the dataset structure, column meanings, data types, and spotting any quality issues.

  3. 🔗 Data Connection
Connecting the raw data into Excel and then bringing cleaned tables into Power BI.

  4. 🧼 Data Cleaning & Quality Check (Excel)
Handling missing values, fixing data types, removing duplicates, standardizing categories, and ensuring data is ready for modeling.

  5. 🧠 Data Modeling (Power BI)
Creating relationships between tables, defining a clear star/snowflake schema, and preparing the model for fast and flexible analysis.

  6. 🧮 DAX Calculations
Writing measures for KPIs such as Total Sales, Average Sales, and Average Rating, plus any calculated columns or additional logic required.

  7. 🎨 Dashboard Layout & Formatting
Designing the layout so that the most important numbers and visuals appear first, with supportive charts arranged in a clean and logical flow.

  8. 📉 Charts Development & Interactions
Selecting the right charts (bar, column, donut, funnel map, matrix, line, etc.), setting up tooltips, and configuring interactions between visuals.

  9. 💡 Insights Generation & Storytelling
Interpreting the results, highlighting key insights (top outlets, best‑performing categories, patterns in ratings, etc.), and framing them as business takeaways.

🧰 Tech Stack & Tools
  * 🧾 Excel – Data cleaning, preprocessing, and initial exploration

  * 📊 Power BI Desktop – Data modeling, DAX, and interactive dashboard creation

  * 🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures and calculations for KPIs

This combination replicates a real‑world BI workflow used in many analytics teams. 🧑‍💻
